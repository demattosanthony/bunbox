Bunbox is a full-stack web framework built on [Bun](https://bun.sh):

- **File-based routing** for pages, APIs, and WebSockets
- **Type-safe APIs** with auto-generated typed client
- **Real-time WebSockets** with pub/sub support
- **Server-side rendering** with full client hydration
- **Zero config** - works out of the box

## Why Bunbox?

### Fast

Built on Bun, Bunbox starts your dev server in milliseconds.

### Simple

No complex configuration. Create files in `app/` and start building.

### Type-Safe

TypeScript support with type-safe routing, API handlers, and WebSocket protocols.

### Complete

Everything you need is built-in: routing, SSR, API routes, and WebSockets.

## Philosophy

Bunbox combines patterns from Next.js (file-based routing), tRPC (end-to-end types), and Socket.io (real-time) into a single, minimal framework.

1. **Convention over configuration** - Sensible defaults that work
2. **Simplicity first** - Easy to learn, easy to use
3. **Performance by default** - Fast development and production builds

## Next Steps

- [Rendering](/docs/rendering) - Understand how SSR and hydration work
