Bunbox is a full-stack web framework built on [Bun](https://bun.sh):

- **File-based routing** - pages, APIs, and sockets
- **Type-safe APIs** - auto-generated typed client
- **Real-time sockets** - WebSocket servers with protocol types
- **SSR with React** - server-side rendering built-in
- **Background workers** - web workers for heavy tasks
- **Zero config** - works out of the box

It's inspired by Next.js (file-based routing), tRPC (end-to-end type safety), and Socket.io (real-time), but stays intentionally tiny and hackable.

## Why Bunbox?

### 🚀 Lightning Fast

Built on Bun, Bunbox starts your development server in milliseconds and delivers blazing-fast build times.

### 🎯 Simple & Intuitive

No complex configuration or boilerplate. Just create files in the `app/` directory and start building.

### 🔒 Type-Safe

Full TypeScript support with type-safe routing, API handlers, and WebSocket protocols.

### 📦 Batteries Included

Everything you need is built-in: routing, SSR, API routes, WebSockets, and more.

## Philosophy

Bunbox is designed to be **100x simpler** than existing frameworks like Next.js, while still providing all the features you need to build production-ready applications. We believe in:

1. **Convention over configuration** - Sensible defaults that just work
2. **Simplicity first** - Easy to learn, easy to use
3. **Performance by default** - Fast development and production builds
4. **Developer experience** - Great DX with hot reload and clear error messages
